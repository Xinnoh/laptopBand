[ Generic Info for Grand Piano key and how to read the naming : ]
C4H.wav , C5S.wav , C6_s.wav
* H means Hard , the sound is a louder than Soft one
* S means Soft , R for Resonance Set
* _s means shorten version, Most of the time, you will want to use this,
     usually for fast piano stream or high BPM piano.
* _s key have around 0.170ms ~ 0.600ms length 
     while the normal one ( e.g. : C4.ogg / F7H.wav / D2R.wav) have around 1.2 ~ 3 scd until
     the sound is completely deplete. Depending on the key, the lower pitch usually have
     longer length.
     

Piano Keys :
C  = do
C# = di
D  = re
D# = ri
E  = mi
F  = fa
F# = fi
G  = sol
G# = si/sel
A  = la
A# = li
B  = ti
 
then repeat again from C(do) with +1 octave... for example :
A4, A#4, B4 >>> C5 , C#5 , D5 and so on.... 
 
『 How to use Piano key sound 』
NORMALLY , you wont need a simple "C4S.wav / C4H.wav"
use that sound only when there is a note that require HOLD or need to
preserve/sustain the sound while holding the key.(or long slider)

For normal key press, most of them can be play correctly using the
"C4S_s.wav / G6R_s.wav " and so on, yes any sound that have "_s" suffix
means its a short sound that fits a quick normal key press especially
for single note.

if you want to use "_s" for a really fast glissando, you will need to SHORTEN
the "_s" length even further, you can try to make it around 0.100s - 0.160s and named
it "_ss" or something. 



『 Editing 』
-Cutting, example from full C4 to make it shorter
 in audacity, first select or highlight the range you want,
 select effect, and apply FADE OUT, then export.
Ex : i cut the full C4 sound into 0.500ms for common piano key press
     and 0.100ms for a very fast piano key press, usually used for a fast descending or fast ascending stair key press, e.g. from C7-C5

Same goes to Organ, if you need a shorter one, use the same method...
select the part you want to make it shorter, highlight and then FADE OUT.
